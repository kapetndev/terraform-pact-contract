# terraform-pact-contract

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this terraform
configuration. A short introduction of this repo could easily go here.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (0.13.4)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd terraform-pact-contract`

## Making Changes

Making changes to the infrastructure requires editing HashiCorp configuration
language files. These describe the desired state of the infrastructure and are
used to inform providers how to query configured APIs.

Changes must be made in a separate branch and a pull request made against the
master branch. When this happens a GitHub action will ensure the changes meet
formatting standards and validate that the configuration is in a consistent
state.
